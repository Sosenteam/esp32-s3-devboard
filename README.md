# ESP32-S3 Devboard :)
This is a ESP32-S3 Dev board for: https://silicon.hackclub.dev/

In addition to the ESP32-S3, I also added three small NeoPixels (which can act as indicator lights), as well as a Time of Flight Sensor (VL53L4CX). It also includes power management (USB -> 3.3v) with surge protection. The board is overall fairly simple because I wanted it to be versatile for whatever project I may need it for.
